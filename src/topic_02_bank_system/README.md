Project: Bank Management System (OOP Practice)

Goal: To simulate a banking backend using Core Java to understand Object-Oriented Principles practically.

Key Concepts Implemented:

Encapsulation: Used private fields for balance to prevent unauthorized direct access.

Abstraction: Created a Security interface to enforce PIN verification rules.

Polymorphism: Processed SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount uniformly using a List<BankAccount>.

Inheritance: Extended the BankAccount abstract class to reuse the deposit() logic.

Future Improvements:

Plan to add Exception Handling for "Insufficient Funds" instead of if-else.

Will integrate a Database (MySQL) later to persist data.
